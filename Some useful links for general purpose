  This one is a MOSFET MAtlab coding which is complex but may be needed.

  I downloaded and put this pdf in Github apart from this link. It describes how
  to model MOSFET in Simulink


Research Reading Summary on GaNFET Navita iDrive (29th April)

  WBG GaN material allows high electric fields so high
  carrier density can be achieved
  50% less loss than RF Si
  • 16x smaller package
  • Air-core inductors
  • Minimal FET loss
  • Negligible gate drive loss

  There are 3 different GaN Packages:
  • Through-hole(this one has limited frequency due to high inductances)
  • Cascode (high cost and additional components)
  • PCB-embedded  (this one has high cost)

  Monolithic GaN is better at overshoots, it suggests that it is
  eliminating some losses like diode, Ton, charge discharge power losses?
  Here Navitas İDrive says that they reduce the capacitances more than 10 times
  drop the time constances whih will affect the charge discharge time(reducing it)
  => switching improved!

  • **(Learn) Turn-off losses are low due to powerful and
parasitic-free(how?) drive integration with no overshoot

  •A VERY IMPORTANT RESULT TO BE TESTED: Saying it needs no heat sink
  runs cool while SiC counterparts run 30-50 deg. hotter and lossy
