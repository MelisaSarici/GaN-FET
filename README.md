I configured the model a little bit. Here I had the problem of configuration solver which I intend to solve later on. I used the parameters provided in the datasheet of GaN-FET site of which we will be using in our upcoming experiments.

Solver configuration is solved, there are two scopes two obtain both input voltage and output current. The output is wrong but will be worked upon later.
