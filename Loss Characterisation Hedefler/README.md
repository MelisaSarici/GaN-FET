After the "evi toparlayayÄ±m" part :D, I left 2 simulink models one of which do not work :D However, as Ozan Hoca mentioned, I tried to run the models part by part. One of the models is the one I tried to build using the MATLAB function blocks to model the theoretical current voltage outputs of the MOSFET. That is, the unnecessary looking details since after talking to Mesut Hoca and my internship, I realized that MOSFET is merely a switch and there is not a fundamental need to model so painstakingly :D.

The second model is the very fresh ("taptaze") version which I started after reading some more documents of modelling a MOSFET in Texas Instruments' document, which is also present in this GitHub folder, and this document certainly helped me to grasp the insides of MOSFET better with detailed but not too dull explanations of the parasitic elements and also different gate driver topologies, which is my second assignment. I believe this document presents some good formulas that can also be tested whether or not they are correct for GaN (or I do not know at the moment-which means another assignment maybe :D- maybe there are some formulas that are already existent for GaN). 

That's all after the first weekly meeting ^_^ (BTW I also added my internship report)
